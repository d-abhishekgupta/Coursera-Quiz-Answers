In this module, you learned that:

Front-end developers work on the parts of the website or app that the user sees and interact with. 

Back-end developers work on the logic and functionality that keeps the website or app running and responding to usersâ€™ inputs. 

Full-stack developers have both sets of skills. 

Front-end developers and back-end developers work closely together. 

Frameworks and libraries extend the functionality of coding languages such as JavaScript and Python. 

Common languages for front-end development include: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Common languages and frameworks for back-end development include: Python, Django, and Flask. 

Version control systems keep track of changes and resolve conflicts between them. 

CI/CD (Continuous Integration with Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is a best practice developers use to deliver frequent changes reliably.
